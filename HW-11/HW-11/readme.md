This week was frustrating but rewarding. I ran into some issues with my sketch showing up from the get-go. I rewrote my code and tweaked a few variables and in the end managed to find my problem. Despite the fact that I struggled to find my issue in my code, I appreciate the time I took carefully examining each line. It forced me to "get to know" my code more in-depth.

I refrenced the issues forum quite a bit this week and I am so happy that I did. Don (DVSnell) was an incredible help and helped me get my polka dot code up and running!
