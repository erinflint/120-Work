#HW 10 Read Me
For this week I decided to make a totally new code. I initially tried working with week 5's code but my sketch just wasn't turning out how I wanted it to so I decided to start over. This week was fun because it was simple for me to understand but also challenged me with having to make my own functions. After I got used to making my own functions I quickly realized just how much easier it made writing my code. I chose the name "moons" for my repeating code because, although my circles aren't moving across the screen in an arc/natural lunar pattern, they still reminded me of the moon as it moves across the sky. I look forward to revisiting this week's lesson and seeing just how much farther defining my own functions will take me.
