## Question 1
For this homework cycle I learned how to use Atom and GitHub Desktop. I chose Atom over Sourcetree per Dr. Musick's suggestion for Mac computers. I also learned about various text editors and their different uses.
Some other components of text editors that I read about:
- plain text
- rich text
- typical features
  1. find and replace
  2. cut, copy, and paste
  3. text formatting
  4. undo and redo
  5. data transformation
  6. filtering
  7. syntax highlighting
  8. extensibility
- **the information about these components were found on** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor]
I also learned about using version control and why it is convenient for tracking changes. The final concept I was able to grasp for the most part is the markup and markdown language which I am using in writing this response.
## Question 2
The steps I took to complete this assignment were quite simple, I read through the Github pages and followed along with the videos.
## Question 3
I had some issues with remembering how to use terminal but I solved them by going back to the week 1 modules and revisiting the information included in them. It wasn't necessary for me to post my issues to the class repo issue tracker because it was easy for me to simply go back to the previous lesson and rewatch a few videos.
## Question 4
I would like to discuss the link between atom and Github more in depth because I'm not entirely sure I completely grasp it. I understand how to use them, I just am unsure as to why they work together and would like to expand my knowledge surrounding that.
## Question 5
I helped my classmate, Cody Krull, out with a few hiccups we encountered when first using GitHub Desktop. We had issues seeing the changes part of the page but resolved it.
