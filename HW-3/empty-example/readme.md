## Assignment 3 Responses
This homework cycle we learned how to utilize p5.js. We did our Hello World page and made a live github site for our personall work. Completing this assignment was quite the task for me personally. I flew through the first half of it and then when it came to the "going live" section my understanding of everything seemed to come to a halt. I simply had to reread/watch some of the modules in order to get my footing again. I had some problems getting my github.io link organized. After using the issues forum and rewatching/reading some modules I was able to figure my problem out. I was having github search in the wrong repository for my Hello World. Looking back on this issue it was easily solvable, I was just overthinking it. One classmate and myself were having the same issue with going live so we responded back and forth in her issues forum. However, I personally didn't directly help anyone but rather was the grateful recipient of assistance from a few students that most definitely have more experience with computers than I do.
