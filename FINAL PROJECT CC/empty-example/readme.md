##Proposal

For my final project I am planning to create a music visualization for one of my favorite songs at the moment. I will have the shapes move with the music and change color as well.

##Influential Artists
I've always been interested in music visualization. I'm not particularly influenced by any certain artists but instead synesthesia. Synesthesia has always fascinated me and, although I personally do not experience it, I think that this project will help give me more insight into what it might feel like.

##Problems I Will Need to Solve, Techniques I Will Need to Learn
I see myself having issues with coding the music into my sketch. I will have to learn how to do this and as with everything new in this class I will inevitably have issues doing so.

##Work Plan
Over the next two weeks I plan on working on my project each night for a minimum of two hours. Since I am unsure as to what problems I will run into I will make concrete deadlines as my piece progresses.

##Current Stage
I am currently reading up on music visualization and watching some Shiffman videos. I have my very basic code written just to get the song to play when my sketch is opened but have not progressed past that.
