## Final Project Log
Nov 29: I ran into a lot of issues attempting to create my original idea so I have decided to completely start over. I always loved Gallaga and Space Invaders as a kid and will attempt to create a very simple game based off of them. I am thinking about making a little man (Isaac Newton) attempt to dodge apples. We'll see where that takes me.
